            New Alipore College was set up on 5th August 1963 as a Government Sponsored College on a large plot of land owned by the Government of West Bengal. The only building of the then Day College, constructed by the Public Works Department, was three-storied. Turned into four-storied much later, it still remains the main building of the College.
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            Making Access and Inclusivity in Quality Education

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            Include, Ignite and Innovate

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            Education for all irrespective of caste, creed, religion, and economic status.

            <h3>Distinctiveness</h3>
            In keeping with the mission of the college we strive towards inclusiveness and equity. The administration ensures that all stakeholders are provided with a level playing field and special care is taken to address the needs of the physically- challenged. The administration has taken extra pains to ensure that a physically-challenged student who is keen to continue his/her education   is allowed to do so even though that meant getting special permission from the affiliating University. Different Depts. have started social outreach programmes by which they try to reach out to the sections of the society with special needs.

            Seminars and talks are arranged at regular intervals to sensitise students and staff to gender equity. The institution has zero tolerance for ragging and both the administration and the Studentsâ€™ Council ensure that the campus is free from any discriminatory practices.

            The Student's Council of the college organizes social and cultural programmes throughout the year, in which all students are free to participate. To foster the feeling of belongingness, an annual feast is organised on the occasion of Basant Panchami, which is attended by students and staff.

            Birth anniversaries of distinguished personalities are celebrated so that their lives and teachings might inspire and ignite the present generation. Seminars and workshops are organised regularly and eminent persons are invited to the college to motivate and inspire the young minds.  Ex-students who are well established are also invited by the Depts. to share their experiences with the present students.

            The annual function, Avensis, showcases the innovative and creative skills of the students. The well researched exhibits prepared by the various Depts. are have been highly appreciated by visitors to the programme.

            Students also participate in various science fairs and exhibitions organised by the State Govt/ other institutions.  Our Students also participate and win awards in photography and documentary-making competitions.  Student's performances in drama deserve special mention as the drama team of our college has been winning many awards for years at different state-levels competitions.
