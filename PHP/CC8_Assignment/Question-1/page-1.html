            New Alipore College was set up on 5th August 1963 as a Government Sponsored College on a large plot of land owned by the Government of West Bengal. The only building of the then Day College, constructed by the Public Works Department, was three-storied. Turned into four-storied much later, it still remains the main building of the College.
